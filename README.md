# YOLO-object-detection-in-java
A java based template for streaming video based object detection using only YOLO weights
  
 ## What this project is about :

While there is lot of focus in doing deep learning based image classification and object detection models in python and consequently there are numerous blogs showing how to do the same there is little information on how to use JAVA based packages like OpenCV in a standalone manner to do image classification and recognition tasks ,this project focuses on a step by step approach on doing a video stream analysis using nothing but JAVA , OpenCV package in java and YOLO . Keep in mind we do not use tensorflow/Darkflow/Darknet  in this project . In next sections  we go thru in detail on what is object detection , what is YOLO and how to implement YOLO using OpenCV and JAVA . We will follow it up with a sample JAVA code using YOLO models to detect objects in Video stream explained in Detail
